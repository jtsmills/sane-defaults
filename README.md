# Sane Defaults

A handful of people have been asking me how I setup my frontends. This repo acts as a template.

This is not necessarily meant to compile - but instead provide an example of sane defaults.

## Explanations

Bundler: Webpack

Linting: Prettier + ESLint

CSS: Css modules + `typings.d.ts` for typescript import

Editor: VSCode + recommended extensions (for linting)

Transpilation: Babel
